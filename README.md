# DESCRIPTION OF THE TASK

Objective:
The Home Automation System is designed to enable users to control multiple household devices (such as lights, fans, and appliances) remotely via a smartphone app or web interface. The system will use a microcontroller (ESP8266, ESP32, or Arduino with Wi-Fi) and an IoT platform (such as Blynk, MQTT, or Firebase) to allow real-time control and automation.

Key Features:
1.Remote Control: Users can turn appliances (lights, fans, etc.) on/off from anywhere using a smartphone or web interface.
2.Automation & Scheduling: Devices can turn on/off automatically based on user-defined schedules.
3.Voice Control (Optional): Integration with Google Assistant, Alexa, or Siri for hands-free operation.
4.Sensor-Based Automation: Motion sensors, temperature sensors, and ambient light sensors can automate device control.
5.Energy Monitoring (Optional): Track energy consumption of connected appliances.
6.Multiple Device Support: Control various appliances from a single interface.

Components Required:
Microcontroller: ESP8266, ESP32, or Arduino with a Wi-Fi module
Relay Modules: To control high-power appliances
Sensors (Optional):
PIR Sensor (motion detection)
DHT11/DHT22 (temperature & humidity)
LDR (light intensity measurement)
IoT Platform: Blynk, MQTT, or Firebase for remote access
Smartphone App or Web Dashboard: For user interaction
Power Supply: Suitable for microcontroller and connected devices

Working Principle:
1.The microcontroller connects to the internet via Wi-Fi.
2.Users send commands through the mobile app or web dashboard.
3.The microcontroller receives these commands and controls the connected appliances.
4.Automation triggers (e.g., motion detected, temperature threshold exceeded) activate specific devices.
